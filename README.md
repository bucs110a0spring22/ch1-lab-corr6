## SUMMARY OF LATE POLICY FOR THE COURSE:
 Every student begins the semester with 5 grace days that can be used throughout the semester. They can be used to add additional days to a lab due date. Late labs that don't use grace days lose 10% of the total possible points for every 24 hour period it is late. Labs can be submitted up until the last day of the semester for a maximum grade of 50%. Professor must be notified to have a lab regraded.
